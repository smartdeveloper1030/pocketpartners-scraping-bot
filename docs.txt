Hey,
Hope you are doing well.

Thanks again for your order!

Contents:
-> pocketoption.zip (Contains python scripts, credentials.env, docs.txt and requirements.txt files, respectively.)
-> guide.mp4 (Guide video)
-> screenshot.png (Portfolio sample)

credentials.env:
-> You can put "email", "password", "google auth secret key and "telegram bot token" in this file.
 (I have already set up the current ones in this file. Make sure to update them once you have
 done any changes regarding them)


Installation:
-> Recommended Python version is 3.10+ or above.
-> Install modules using the following command:
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

-> Run the Python script using
   python main.py
(In the case of Linux or MacOS, use python3 instead of Python.)

How it works?
-> After starting the script, it will try to login to the dashboard by
  loading the old session cookies (if saved earlier) or doing the login process using the 
  credentials loaded from "credentials.env" file. It will save the session cookies if its a new login.
-> After logging-in, it will scrape the latest data from the dashboard, update the local database and send alerts accordingly.
-> There are three operations scheduled to run at specific interval of time:
  1. Scraping Latest data -> scheduled to run at "59th" minute of every hour.
  2. Sending Alert to Telegram -> scheduled to run at ":00" timing of every hour.
  3. The third and final job is "Auto-Withdrawal". It will run at ":01" and will check the condition for "withdrawal" and will alert you on telegram on successful withdrawal.
-> That's it.


If there are any problems, please let me know. I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

I am looking forward to working with you again.
Thanks again and have a great day! :)
